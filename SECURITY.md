# Security policy
We want to keep Lodger safe for everyone.

## Program Rules
Ensuring robust security is a collective responsibility. We acknowledge the crucial contributions made towards maintaining Lodger's safety and, in appreciation, offer a bounty for reporting specific, eligible security vulnerabilities. Prior to reporting a vulnerability, we urge you to familiarize yourself with the subsequent program guidelines. Your participation in this program signifies your agreement to adhere to these rules.

### Encountered a Security Concern?
If you detect a potential security vulnerability in any Lodger software, we strongly urge immediate reporting. We pledge to diligently examine all authentic reports and expedite resolving the concern.

For reporting sensitive security issues, kindly utilize Lodger's bug-bounty program (https://hackerone.com/lodger) instead of GitHub. We will collaborate with you to ensure comprehensive understanding of the problem. We consider security reports our highest priority.
