# Contributing to Lodger Projects
Our aim is to make contributing to Lodger projects as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development
All changes are made through pull requests, which are the best way to propose modifications. Please note that our conventions may differ from what you are accustomed to. Reading this document will help you save time and collaborate effectively with the developers at Lodger. For more information, please refer to [DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/lodgerapp/.github/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Issues
We utilize GitHub issues to track all public bugs. Before creating a new issue, please search for existing ones. Ensure your description is clear and includes sufficient instructions to reproduce the issue accurately.

For the secure disclosure of security bugs, Lodger has a [bounty program](https://github.com/lodgerapp/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md). In such cases, please follow the process outlined on that page instead of filing a public issue on GitHub.
